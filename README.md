# The Future of Beauty 

## HEAD MA Media Design - 12.2025 project

### BRIEF

#### The Poetics of Technology: how will care look like in 2040?

Realise an object for beauty and care, building a scenario in 2040. 
The interaction with the object is simple, poetic and sensorial (touch, sound, light). 
Envision a daily routine, a daily ritual involving a simple gesture. 
Technology needs to disappear in the process. 
Be speculative. Feedback loop is important. 

The project is also about DA, and scenario building. Coherence and visual identity development. 
 
### CLAIRE + LEA STUDIO 
Use robots not for efficiency but for poetics. 

Imagine a character: where, who? What time of the day does the routine refer to? What are the gestures? 

Think about the material: locally sourcesd, soft, rigid, organic, amber, stone, resin transparent. 

Embedded ideas: masculinity, femininity. 
Think about a companion, something that is emotional, like an amuleto/portafortuna. 
Thoughts on care from class discussion:
- care is not mandatory or necessary
- treating yourself and others 
- stretching
- looking at the world with softness
- objects of care: cup, bed, bathtub, amuleto, pillow, blanket, time, floor, piano, essential herbs, towel, water, game controller, malleable shapeless material, mirror

### SABRINA CALVO - Design Fiction

Scenario is obsolete. 

It is not aboutt building a story linearly, from alpha to omega. 

In Indian culture, the arm represents the world: the shoulder, all the possibilities of movement. The elbow, the contraints. The hand, the material world. 

1. Affect, intention. What thing do i want to express?
2. Idea. Put it in words. 
3. Scenario
4. Context. The frame in which you apply the scenario. This is the "world model". You cannot design a spoon if in the future world people will have no arms. 

The NOVUM is the thing that allows the world to change (ex. for DUNE, it is spice). 

The difference between sci-fi and fantasy is VEROSIMILITUDE. 

The SELF role. What is our relation to the self?

Beauty. What is beauty? Beauty is the IDEA of beauty, which changes with time. it is a truth, and truth is based on trust. Trust in human connection between human beings. Nowadays, we are loosing trust and we are becoming slaves of ourselves. 

GLAMOUR (Gaelic word) = illusion, power of fairies. 

CARE = dal latino cura, curae. Preoccupation, worry. 

Some ideas about destroying taboos. 


- shitless panties
- goggles so that everybody can walk naked in the streets
- clothes that serve as shroud so people are buried with them. 
- Chanel garbage bag. 
- Makeup becomes a way to alter your face, to fuck up with AI. 
- sleep is political

What about sexuality? Fashion thrives on the repression of death and sex. 

Fashion is repression, organisation of world around the tension for the orgasm without ever reaching it. 
What does it mean to be a queer person in fashion? No patronising, no heterosexual, but also no explicit penetration.
