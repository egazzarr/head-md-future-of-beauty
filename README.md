#### What if you could wear the universe on your skin?

In 2040, the meteor 19OQ2 is grazing the Earth's atmosphere.

At impact, it breaks up into small meteorites, which disperse on the Earth's surface.

Specialized laboratories process and turn the meteorites into golden dust particles, which are very sensitive to external magnetic fields. The powder is then combined with specific bacteria that decompose the metallic particles and that thrive in strong magnetic forces. This sophisticated amalgam constitutes the base material of the CHANEL N.19OQ2 beauty care experience.

In 2040, it is common to find clusters of people who search for intimate connections through shared, simple, physical moments. A common activity is to meet up at the end of the day in an open, outdoor space. Chanel has conceived an ultimate experience that unifies the simplicity of such moments with the cosmic effects of the meteorite's dust.

The product is usually shared between two or more people, as it requires time and attention to keep the mixture alive by watering it and nourishing it with light.
When people meet to live the experience, the elegant, sleek cream container allows one person to spread the CHANEL N.19OQ2 product on their face, and their partner to use its magnetized lid to massage their face at a distance. The meteorite metallic particles spread on the skin gently react to the lid's magnetic field, generating a pleasant, light and delicious sensation. The micro-massage acts on the facial muscles, relaxes the whole body and deepens the connection between the people involved in the ritual.

The bacteria keep the cream alive and help decompose it once the ritual is over. The CHANEL N.19OQ2 experience is a shared dance between individuals, cosmic debris and microscopic life.

### BRIEF

#### The Poetics of Technology: how will care look like in 2040?

Realise an object for beauty and care, building a scenario in 2040. 
The interaction with the object is simple, poetic and sensorial (touch, sound, light). 
Envision a daily routine, a daily ritual involving a simple gesture. 
Technology needs to disappear in the process. 
Be speculative. Feedback loop is important. 

The project is also about DA, and scenario building. Coherence and visual identity development. 

### INTERVENTIONS
 
#### CLAIRE + LEA STUDIO 
Use robots not for efficiency but for poetics. 

Imagine a character: where, who? What time of the day does the routine refer to? What are the gestures? 

Think about the material: locally sourcesd, soft, rigid, organic, amber, stone, resin transparent. 

Embedded ideas: masculinity, femininity. 
Think about a companion, something that is emotional, like an amuleto/portafortuna. 
Thoughts on care from class discussion:
- care is not mandatory or necessary
- treating yourself and others 
- stretching
- looking at the world with softness
- objects of care: cup, bed, bathtub, amuleto, pillow, blanket, time, floor, piano, essential herbs, towel, water, game controller, malleable shapeless material, mirror

#### SABRINA CALVO - Design Fiction

Scenario is obsolete. 

It is not aboutt building a story linearly, from alpha to omega. 

In Indian culture, the arm represents the world: the shoulder, all the possibilities of movement. The elbow, the contraints. The hand, the material world. 

1. Affect, intention. What thing do i want to express?
2. Idea. Put it in words. 
3. Scenario
4. Context. The frame in which you apply the scenario. This is the "world model". You cannot design a spoon if in the future world people will have no arms. 

The NOVUM is the thing that allows the world to change (ex. for DUNE, it is spice). 

The difference between sci-fi and fantasy is VEROSIMILITUDE. 

The SELF role. What is our relation to the self?

Beauty. What is beauty? Beauty is the IDEA of beauty, which changes with time. it is a truth, and truth is based on trust. Trust in human connection between human beings. Nowadays, we are loosing trust and we are becoming slaves of ourselves. 

GLAMOUR (Gaelic word) = illusion, power of fairies. 

CARE = dal latino cura, curae. Preoccupation, worry. 

Some ideas about destroying taboos. 


- shitless panties
- goggles so that everybody can walk naked in the streets
- clothes that serve as shroud so people are buried with them. 
- Chanel garbage bag. 
- Makeup becomes a way to alter your face, to fuck up with AI. 
- sleep is political

What about sexuality? Fashion thrives on the repression of death and sex. 

Fashion is repression, organisation of world around the tension for the orgasm without ever reaching it. 
What does it mean to be a queer person in fashion? No patronising, no heterosexual, but also no explicit penetration.
